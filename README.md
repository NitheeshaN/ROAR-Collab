These slides are part of a workshop I presented at the Center for Social Data Analytics at Penn State University. In this workshop I introduce the Penn State High Performance Computing system and how to access it using ROAR Collab. I also provide a tutorial on how to use Jupyter Notebook and RStudio using an interactive session on ROAR Collab. This includes an overview of computer architecture and what an HPC is made up of. I hope these slides are helpful and please feel free to contact me with any questions.
